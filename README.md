Unit testing





### Airdropping

- Holders of a Ronin Cat NFT will receive 70 $HONOUR every week for 10 years


### Breeding

- Burn 600 $HONOUR to receive a “Ronin Kitten”
- Must be holding 2 Ronin Cat NFT’s
- Only 500 total circulating supply of “Ronin Kittens”




// QUESTIONS //

10 HONOUR per day, or 70 HONOUR per week? I.e. can people claim daily or weekly?

Do you want unclaimed HONOUR to be lost upon RoninCat NFT transfer, or does the new HONOUR inherit the unclaimed reward?
Kongz contract lets user keep unclaimed reward. I say we just pay out thier reward upon transfer because easier to implement.


10 year limit on HONOUR rewards claims from time of contract deployment, ok?
