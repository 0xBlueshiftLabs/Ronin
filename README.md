## $HONOUR token

Each Cat will accrue 10 $HONOUR every 24 hours. $HONOUR can be claimed at any point and will be used to recruit new cats for your clan. $HONOUR will provide extra utility when the battle begins and will be used for cosmetic in-game purchases. Any unclaimed $HONOUR is still claimable after a transfer of ownership.


## Recruiting

When a holder of 2 or more Ronin Cats has enough $HONOUR, they will be able to begin recruiting. There are five types of cats you can recruit for your clan: Merchants, Craftsman, Samurai, Daimyo, and of course, Musicians. Each type of cat will have a different play style and can be used in conjunction with your other cats for unique combinations and strategies.

- Burn 600 $HONOUR to mint a “Ronin Recruit”
- Must be holding 2 Ronin Cat NFTs
- Total supply of 500
